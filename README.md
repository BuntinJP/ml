Jupyter notebooks created for my research on machine learning.
No license. Please feel free to use it if you can.

Only where the internals are changed by the data for reusability are defined as variables at the beginning of the cell; if you change there by Dataframe, you can implement simple machine learning with multiple algorithms including neural networks, linear regression, and LightGBM.

For more information, contact my discord(link is at my github profile).

In addition, the main libraries used are.

- LightGBM
- ScikitLearn
- PyTorch
- Tensorflow
- pandas
- numpy
